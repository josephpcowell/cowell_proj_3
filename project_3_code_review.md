## Clean Code:

- Very good job coding. Next step is to create functions for your modeling process and place them into a py file. 

## Good Documentation:

- Good readme, liked the links. Reminder to include your key findings.
- Well done! Code was easy to follow and understand. I like how you explained each step and the key findings from the steps

## Proper Data Science:

- I liked how you talked through you entire modeling process.
- Great job working through tuning hyperparameters for xgboost
- Good visualizations and app. 

## Comments:

- Good job on project 3. 
- Working through a classic fraud detection is a great project. Understanding this work flow (and doing it well) often leads to job opportunities.
- Nice visualizations and analysis (provide more insight language in your github)
- Be sure to include a "results" section in your README in the future -- just a quick high-level overview of your key takeaways!
